# Semantic Video Search Backend
A project created for 2019 Pytorch Summer Hackathon in Menlo Park, CA.  This is the backend for an intelligent video search system that allows a user to search for specific content within a large volume of video, without any need for manual labelling of semantic content in the video.

# Environment:
- Python 3.7.4
- Pytorch 1.2
- torchvision
- torchtext
- torchaudio
- spacy
- scipy
- numpy
- speechrecognition
